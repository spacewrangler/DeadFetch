Goofing around with golang to learn. What better way than to explore GD shows?
Fetch Grateful Dead shows from archive.org and index them to Elasticsearch to answer interesting questions, e.g.: 
* Favorite years? '72 and '77? ;)
* How did setlists change over time?
* How did venues change over time?
* Distribution of songs - e.g. when did they appear/disappear from shows? How does that map to band makeup?
* Correlation of certain songs to higher reviews?
